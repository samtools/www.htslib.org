<p>
Shuffles and groups reads together by their names.
A faster alternative to a full query name sort,
<b>collate</b>
ensures that reads of the same name are grouped together in contiguous groups,
but doesn't make any guarantees about the order of read names between groups.
<p>
The output from this command should be suitable for any operation that
requires all reads from the same template to be grouped together.
<p>
If present, &lt;prefix&gt; is used to name the temporary files that collate
uses when sorting the data.  If neither the <b>-O</b> nor <b>-o</b> options are used,
&lt;prefix&gt; must be present and collate will use it to make an output file name
by appending a suffix depending on the format written (.bam by default).
<p>
If either the <b>-O</b> or <b>-o</b> option is used, &lt;prefix&gt; is optional.  If &lt;prefix&gt;
is absent, collate will write the temporary files to a system-dependent
location (/tmp on UNIX).
<p>
Using <b>-f</b> for fast mode will output <b>only</b> primary alignments that have
either the READ1 <b>or</b> READ2 flags set (but not both).
Any other alignment records will be filtered out.
The collation will only work correctly if there are no more than two reads
for any given QNAME after filtering.
<p>
Fast mode keeps a buffer of alignments in memory so that it can write out
most pairs as soon as they are found instead of storing them in temporary
files.
This allows collate to avoid some work and so finish more quickly compared
to the standard mode.
The number of alignments held can be changed using <b>-r</b>, storing more alignments
uses more memory but increases the number of pairs that can be written early.
<p>
While collate normally randomises the ordering of read pairs, fast mode
does not.
Position-dependent biases that would normally be broken up can remain in the
fast collate output.
It is therefore not a good idea to use fast mode when preparing data for
programs that expect randomly ordered paired reads.
For example using fast collate instead of the standard mode may lead to
significantly different results from aligners that estimate library insert
sizes on batches of reads.
