<p>
Shuffles and groups reads together by their names.
A faster alternative to a full query name sort,
<b>collate</b>
ensures that reads of the same name are grouped together in contiguous groups,
but doesn't make any guarantees about the order of read names between groups.
<p>
The output from this command should be suitable for any operation that
requires all reads from the same template to be grouped together.
<p>
Temporary files are written to &lt;prefix&gt;, specified either as the last
argument or with the <b>-T</b> option.  If prefix is unspecified then
one will be derived from the output filename (<b>&ndash;o</b> option).
If no output file was given then the <b>TMPDIR</b> environment variable will be
used, and finally if that is unset then "/tmp" is used.
<p>
Conversely, if prefix is specified but no output filename has been
given then the output will be written to &lt;prefix&gt;.&lt;fmt&gt; where &lt;fmt&gt;
is appropriate to the file format is use (e.g. "bam" or "cram").
<p>
Using <b>-f</b> for fast mode will output <b>only</b> primary alignments that have
either the READ1 <b>or</b> READ2 flags set (but not both).
Any other alignment records will be filtered out.
The collation will only work correctly if there are no more than two reads
for any given QNAME after filtering.
<p>
Fast mode keeps a buffer of alignments in memory so that it can write out
most pairs as soon as they are found instead of storing them in temporary
files.
This allows collate to avoid some work and so finish more quickly compared
to the standard mode.
The number of alignments held can be changed using <b>-r</b>, storing more alignments
uses more memory but increases the number of pairs that can be written early.
<p>
While collate normally randomises the ordering of read pairs, fast mode
does not.
Position-dependent biases that would normally be broken up can remain in the
fast collate output.
It is therefore not a good idea to use fast mode when preparing data for
programs that expect randomly ordered paired reads.
For example using fast collate instead of the standard mode may lead to
significantly different results from aligners that estimate library insert
sizes on batches of reads.
<p>
<h1 id="OPTIONS"><a href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl><dt><b>-O</b></dt><dd><p>
Output to stdout.  This option cannot be used with <b>-o</b>.
</dd><dt><b>-o </b><em>FILE</em></dt><dd><p>
Write output to FILE.  This option cannot be used with <b>-O</b>.  If
unspecified and <b>-O</b> is not set, the temporary file &lt;prefix&gt; is
used, appended by the the appropriate file-format suffix.
</dd><dt><b>-T </b><em>PREFIX</em></dt><dd><p>
Use <em>PREFIX</em> for temporary files.  This is the same as specifying
<em>PREFIX</em> as the last argument on the command line.  This option
is included for consistency with <b>samtools sort</b>.
</dd><dt><b>-u</b></dt><dd><p>
Write uncompressed BAM output
</dd><dt><b>-l </b><em>INT</em></dt><dd><p>
Compression level.
[1]
</dd><dt><b>-n </b><em>INT</em></dt><dd><p>
Number of temporary files to use.
[64]
</dd><dt><b>-f</b></dt><dd><p>
Fast mode (primary alignments only).
</dd><dt><b>-r </b><em>INT</em></dt><dd><p>
Number of reads to store in memory (for use with -f).
[10000]
</dd><dt><b>--no-PG</b></dt><dd><p>
Do not add a @PG line to the header of the output file.
</dd><dt><b>-@, --threads </b><em>INT</em></dt><dd><p>
Number of input/output compression threads to use in addition to main thread [0].
