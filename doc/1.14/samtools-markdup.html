<h1 id="DESCRIPTION"><a href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>
Mark duplicate alignments from a coordinate sorted file that
has been run through <b>samtools fixmate</b> with the <b>-m</b> option.  This program
relies on the MC and ms tags that fixmate provides.

<dl><dt><b>-l </b><em>INT</em></dt><dd><p>
Expected maximum read length of <em>INT</em> bases.

Remove duplicate reads.

Print some basic stats. See STATISTICS.

Mark supplementary reads of duplicates as duplicates.
</dd><dt><b>-f </b><em>file</em></dt><dd><p>
Write stats to named file.
</dd><dt><b>-d </b><em>distance</em></dt><dd><p>
The optical duplicate distance.  Suggested settings of 100 for HiSeq style
platforms or about 2500 for NovaSeq ones.  Default is 0 to not look for
optical duplicates.  When set, duplicate reads are tagged with <b>dt:Z:SQ</b> for
optical duplicates and <b>dt:Z:LB</b> otherwise.  Calculation of distance depends
on coordinate data embedded in the read names produced by the Illumina
sequencing machines.  Optical duplicate detection will not work on non standard
names.
</dd><dt><b>-c</b></dt><dd><p>
Clear previous duplicate settings and tags.
</dd><dt><b>-t</b></dt><dd><p>
Mark duplicates with the name of the original in a <b>do</b> tag.
</dd><dt><b>-m, --mode </b><em>TYPE</em></dt><dd><p>
Duplicate decision method for paired reads.  Values are <b>t</b> or <b>s</b>.
Mode <b>t</b> measures positions based on template start/end (default).
Mode <b>s</b> measures positions based on sequence start.
While the two methods identify mostly the same reads as duplicates, mode 
<b>s</b> tends to return more results.  Unpaired reads are treated identically
by both modes.
</dd><dt><b>-u</b></dt><dd><p>
Output uncompressed SAM, BAM or CRAM.
</dd><dt><b>--include-fails</b></dt><dd><p>
Include quality checked failed reads.
</dd><dt><b>--no-multi-dup</b></dt><dd><p>
Stop checking duplicates of duplicates for correctness.  While still marking
reads as duplicates further checks to make sure all optical duplicates are found
are not carried out.  Also operates on <b>-t</b> tagging where reads may tagged
with a better quality read but not necessarily the best one.  Using this option
can speed up duplicate marking when there are a great many duplicates for each
original read. 
</dd><dt><b>--no-PG</b></dt><dd><p>
Do not add a PG line to the output file.
</dd><dt><b>-@, --threads </b><em>INT</em></dt><dd><p>
Number of input/output compression threads to use in addition to main thread [0].

Entries are:
<br>
<b>COMMAND</b>: the command line.
<br>
<b>READ</b>: number of reads read in.
<br>
<b>WRITTEN</b>: reads written out.
<br>
<b>EXCLUDED</b>: reads ignored.  See below.
<br>
<b>EXAMINED</b>: reads examined for duplication.
<br>
<b>PAIRED</b>: reads that are part of a pair.
<br>
<b>SINGLE</b>: reads that are not part of a pair.
<br>
<b>DUPLICATE PAIR</b>: reads in a duplicate pair.
<br>
<b>DUPLICATE SINGLE</b>: single read duplicates.
<br>
<b>DUPLICATE PAIR OPTICAL</b>: optical duplicate paired reads.
<br>
<b>DUPLICATE SINGLE OPTICAL</b>: optical duplicate single reads.
<br>
<b>DUPLICATE NON PRIMARY</b>: supplementary/secondary duplicate reads.
<br>
<b>DUPLICATE NON PRIMARY OPTICAL</b>: supplementary/secondary optical
duplicate reads.
<br>
<b>DUPLICATE PRIMARY TOTAL</b>: number of primary duplicate reads.
<br>
<b>DUPLICATE TOTAL</b>: total number of duplicate reads.
<br>
<b>ESTIMATED LIBRARY SIZE</b>: estimate of the number of unique fragments in the
sequencing library.
<p>
<p>
Estimated library size makes various assumptions e.g. the library consists of
unique fragments that are randomly selected (with replacement) with equal
probability.
This is unlikely to be true in practice.
However it can provide a useful guide into how many unique read pairs are likely 
to be available.
In particular it can be used to determine how much more data might be obtained
by further sequencing of the library.
<p>
Excluded reads are those marked as secondary, supplementary or unmapped.
By default QC failed reads are also excluded but can be included as an option.
Excluded reads are not used for calculating duplicates.
They can optionally be marked as duplicates if they have a primary that is also
a duplicate.    
<h1 id="EXAMPLES"><a href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
This first collate command can be omitted if the file is already name ordered or collated:
<pre>
samtools collate -o namecollate.bam example.bam
</pre>
<p>
Add ms and MC tags for markdup to use later:
<pre>
samtools fixmate -m namecollate.bam fixmate.bam
</pre>
<p>
Markdup needs position order:
<pre>
samtools sort -o positionsort.bam fixmate.bam
</pre>
<p>
Finally mark duplicates:
<pre>
samtools markdup positionsort.bam markdup.bam
</pre>
<p>
Typically the fixmate step would be applied immediately after sequence
alignment and the markdup step after sorting by chromosome and
position.  Thus no <em>additional</em> sort steps are normally needed.
